# Plant Disease Detection Model

A deep learning-based computer vision system for automatically detecting and classifying plant diseases from leaf images using PyTorch and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a neural network model that can classify plant diseases with **99.4% accuracy** on the test set. The model takes plant leaf images as input and predicts the disease category, enabling early detection and treatment of plant diseases.

## üöÄ Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 99.4% test accuracy on plant disease classification
- **Deep Learning**: Implemented using PyTorch with custom CNN architecture
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized for training on GPU (T4) for faster computation
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive image transformations and normalization
- **Modular Design**: Clean, well-structured code for easy understanding and extension

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture
```python
Sequential(
    Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    ReLU(),
    MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
    Flatten(),
    Linear(32*64*64, 3)
)
